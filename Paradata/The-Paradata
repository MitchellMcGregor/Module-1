About The Object- Why Choose a Book?
I like the directory as an object though- at first I was worried it was too plain as visual historical material, 
because its useful and interesting qualities come from the text it holds inside. However, I believe there is something 
in the abstraction of this purpose. By removing access to its text (as a digital model) I'm forcing the audience to 
reconsider the directory as a historical object- not for information, but as information. Typically published works are
analyzed historically for the style, content and context of the author's work, but in the absence of the text, the audience
must consider the Directory itself. This can lead to questions about the utility and access of the book, the places 
it may have travelled, the process of its production, and most interestingly, the meaning it may have held over time.
