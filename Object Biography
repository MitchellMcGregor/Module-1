Object: City of Ottawa Directory, 1930

Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Major Canadian cities like Halifax, Ottawa and Kingston
began publishing City Directories. These phonebook-precursors contained addresses of both private 
households and commercial businesses, alphabetically and by street, with information regarding head
of household, occupation, and type of dwelling. They were repositories of information about 
residents and businesses, and guides to the built urban landscape. 
Today, they are useful materials for historians conducting research on a wide range of topics related 
to urban social, economic and cultural histories. They contain quantifiable data about spatial 
economic settlement through the inclusion of occupations, mapping of immigration and ethnic 
communities by last names, even gender norms by viewing who was viewed as the head of the household
by the directory. The directories are limited in their scope, and the bias in the collection, ommissions
and publication of its information must be considered, but as a tool they are useful to urban historians.
This Directory was compiled and published in 1930 by Might Directories Limited. It is a copyright
of Canada.
