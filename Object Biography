Object: City of Ottawa Directory, 1930

Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Major Canadian cities like Halifax, Ottawa and Kingston
began publishing City Directories. These phonebook precursors contained addresses of both private 
households and commercial businesses alphabetically and by street, with information regarding head
of household, occupation, and type of dwelling. They were repositories of residents and businesses,
and guides to the built urban landscape. 
This Directory was compiled and published in 1930 by Might Directories Limited. It is a copyright
of Canada.
