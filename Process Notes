Object 1- Ottawa Directory
Attempt 1- After downloading Trnio as my first photogammetry tool, I used the only historic Ottawa object I own, 
readily available on my bookcase. 
The tutorial video on Trnio website gave some tips, similar to the ones discussed in class. Use good lighting, get
different angles, keep an even distance from the object. Don't do transparent, shiny, moving or sinewy objects, but 
aslo not anything too plain. Despite the tutorial advising not to do a simple object, I decided to try my city 
directory, a plain brown book, just to try it out.
